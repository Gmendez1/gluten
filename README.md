What I learned
I learned a lot about grids and assigning sections of the screen to different things. I also learned minor animation, through the animated text on my hero section. I also learned about how to code many different types of buttons. 

Overall experience 
I really found this project challenging. I found getting the type to where it needs to go on the grid was overwhelming with all the lines of code. I also wasn't able to create exactly what I had envisioned in my mock up with small things like my footer being strange and the site not being the most responsive especially in the hero section. However I think I did ok in getting close to 
what I wanted and I built new skills.
