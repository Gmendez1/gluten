                <p>
                  Gluten was designed by ETC, Etcetera Type Company. Released in August of 2018 it has had a few updates since then. Its creators aimed for it to be “loud, very round, and 100% fun.” It's a sans serif font capable of changing weights and slant. The creators say the biggest challenge they faced developing this font was maintaining its quirkiness throughout its different looks. Especially from is thickest to its thinnest as the personality of the font really shines at its heaviest. The developers say the font “celebrates every curve, nook, and cranny.” They also say they developed the italic for emphasis and the reverse italic for “ridiculous emphasis.”
